An analysis project exploring visual traits in AI-generated portraits using TensorArt and Tableau.

- Hair length was overwhelmingly long (97%).

## Tools Used
- TensorArt (Image generation)
- Google Sheets (Data entry)
- Tableau (Data visualization)
- Git & GitHub (Version control)

## Next Steps
- Expand dataset with more diverse prompts
- Perform clustering or correlation analysis
- Compare across models
